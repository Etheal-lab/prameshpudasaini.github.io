</p>

- **Objective**: propose and test an ML-based optimization framework to reidentify vehicles between detector locations while approaching an intersection
- **Challenges**
  - vehicles approaching an intersection detected at discrete locations, but not linked or connected
  - reidentification difficult in case of non-visual data from loop detectors
  - lack of cheap and high-quality driver behavior data (that could be obtained from reidentification) at safety-critical yellow onset periods
- **Contributions**
  - proposed a novel reidentification framework with two components: ML models for accurately predicting the travel time between detectors and an optimization model that utilizes these predicted travel time and actuation events for reidentifying vehicles
  - four ML models (Decision Tree Regression, Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost) tested for predicting travel time between detectors based on information available at only the advance location [code](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/vehicle_reidentification/blob/main/script/ML_reidentification.ipynb)
  - 95.4% precision and 92% recall obtained in vehicle reidentification by the XGBoost-based framework
  - superior reidentification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art analytical models
- **Tools used**: SQL, Python for data processing and optimization, R for analysis and visualization, [GitHub](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/vehicle_reidentification)

</p>

- **Objective**: empirically analyze existing dilemma zone quantifications to assess their consistency and overlap
- **Challenges**
  - inaccurate results of zone boundary and subsequent safety analyses if dilemma zones are quantified differently
  - integrated analysis and comparison of Type I and II dilemma zones unavailable in existing literature
- **Contributions**
  - proposed a novel rule-based analytical matching algorithm (with accuracy improvements over existing models) to match actuation events between detector locations
  - estimated driving behavior parameters defined by Type I dilemma zone using high-resolution signal and detector data
  - found 13.2% of vehicles falling into an indecision zone or making stop/go decisions contrary to the laws of physics while approaching an intersection
  - first study to assess consistency and overlap of different dilemma zone quantifications
- **Tools used**: SQL, Python for data processing and analysis, R for visualization, [GitHub](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/dilemma_zone)

  <span style="font-size: smaller;">Single-channel advance video detection (left), queueing phenomenon and breakpoints (right)</span>
</p>

- **Objective**: estimate cycle-based maximum queue length in real time using single-channel advance detector data
- **Challenges**
  - volume underestimation with single-channel detection scheme and noisy detection from video sensors
  - arrival information of vehicles not available beyond the advance detector
  - data available from only the advance detector at target intersection
- **Contributions**
  - proposed an estimation methodology based on queuing phenomenon and empirical observation of breakpoints when vehicles pass the advance detector
  - real-time queue estimation with 86% accuracy, obviating the need for manual calibration of threshold parameters
- **Tools used**: SQL, R for data processing and visualization, [GitHub](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/queue_estimation)

- **Objective**: pre-disaster planning and performance evaluation of rural road networks in case of link disruption
- **Contributions**
  - proposed two mathematical metrics for quantifying network redundancy in context of rural roads; metrics are based on the change in total travel distance for rerouting the network traffic when a link fails
  - performed redundancy analysis for a real-world rural road network by implementing Dijkstra's and k-shortest path algorithms in MATLAB
  - developed a decision-support tool for a priori identification of critical road links and maintenance prioritization of existing alternative links
