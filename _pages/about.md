## Work & Research

My research focuses on engineering data-driven solutions to traffic operations and safety problems by using statistics, machine learning, and operations research tools.

## Background & History

Prior to starting my PhD in August 2021, I worked for 4.5 years as a Deputy Manager at Nepal Oil Corporation Limited (NOCL), a government company managing import, transportation, storage, and distribution of petroleum products in Nepal. In this role, I managed procurement and contract of medium-scale civil construction and consulting tasks, assisted senior project managers and the department director on large-scale projects, and mentored three junior engineers and two overseers.
