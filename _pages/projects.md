</p>

- **Scope**: DTA modeling of Valencia corridor using DynusT
- **Tasks**
  - updated DynusT base model for the Pima County region with 2021 demand data for cars and trucks collected from StreetLight Insight platform
  - calibrated and validated the base model through iterative simulation
  - performed detailed analysis of the base model and three scenarios for different measures of effectiveness
- **Tools used**: DynusT for DTA simulation, Python for data processing, R for data visualization
- **Publication**: Y.-J. Wu and **P. Pudasaini**, ‚ÄúDynamic traffic assignment modeling of Valencia Corridor,‚Äù Pima County Department of Transportation, Tech. Rep., May 2023.
- **Affiliation**: Graduate Research Assistant, Center for Applied Transportation Sciences, University of Arizona

</p>

- **Scope**: statistical comparison of traffic data for traffic signal retiming
- **Tasks**
  - conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify measures for corridor mobility analysis and network-wide performance evaluation using multiple traffic data sources
  - programmed and deployed scripts using R Shiny, SQL, and Docker to develop a network-wide mobility assessment tool for assessing corridor-level traffic operations and safety metrics
  - proposed a methodology to create time-space diagrams along consecutive intersections using high-resolution event data from signal controllers and detectors
- **Tools used**: SQL, R for data analysis and visualization
- **Publication**: Y.-J. Wu, A. Karimpour, and **P. Pudasaini**, ‚ÄúStatistical comparisons of traffic data for traffic signal retiming,‚Äù City of Phoenix Street Transportation Department, Tech. Rep., December 2022.
