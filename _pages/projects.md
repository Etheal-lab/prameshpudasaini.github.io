# Research: Rural Road Network Redundancy (2020)

- **Focus**: multi-objective optimization of petroleum transportation network under demand uncertainty
- **Goals**: develop a mathematical multi-objective optimization model; analyze Pareto optimal solutions in deterministic and stochastic settings
- **Tools used**: [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) for optimization ([code sample](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/biobjective_petroleum/blob/main/optimization/gams-stochastic-t3.gms)), Excel for data analysis & visualization
- **Affiliation**: Master's student at Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University; Deputy Manager at Nepal Oil Corporation Limited
- **Publication**: "Integrated planning of downstream petroleum supply chain: a multi-objective stochastic approach" ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orp.2021.100189))
