# Wireless Traffic Communication
### *Project with the City of Phoenix Street Transportation Department (5/2023 - Present)*

- **Scope**: evaluating effectiveness of wireless communication devices to supplement fiber optics at nodes with gaps/breaks in communication
- **Tasks**
  - reviewed technical specification and protocols of nine communication devices suggested by the City of Phoenix team; coordinated communication with corresponding vendors for price quotes
  - formulated an experimental design for quantitatively assessing communication and cost effectiveness of different devices
  - coordinate installation of selected devices at test sites; collect and analyze before-after data for evaluating communication performance (ongoing)
- **Tools used**: SQL, Python for data processing, R for data visualization

# Evaluating Traffic Counts from Existing Sensors
### *NCHRP Project Collaboration with the Texas Transportation Institute (5/2023 - Present)*

- **Scope**: leveraging existing traffic signals to obtain quality traffic counts and enhance transportation monitoring programs
- **Tasks**
  - collaborated with the Texas Transportation Institute (TTI) team to determine the feasibility of using existing or enhanced traffic equipment to collect, store, and disseminate data for traffic monitoring purposes
  - coordinated with stakeholders and transportation agencies in Arizona to obtain traffic count data from existing traffic sensors
  - prepare User Guide on effective practices for obtaining and integrating traffic counts from existing sensors (ongoing)

</p>

- **Scope**: DTA modeling of Valencia corridor using DynusT
- **Tasks**
  - updated DynusT base model for the Pima County region with 2021 demand data for cars and trucks collected from StreetLight Insight platform
  - calibrated and validated the base model through iterative simulation
  - performed detailed analysis and cross-comparison of the base model and three scenarios for different measures of effectiveness
- **Tools used**: DynusT for DTA simulation, Python for data processing, R for data visualization
- **Publication**: Y.-J. Wu and **P. Pudasaini**, ‚ÄúDynamic traffic assignment modeling of Valencia Corridor,‚Äù Pima County Department of Transportation, Tech. Rep., May 2023.

</p>

- **Scope**: statistical comparison of traffic data for traffic signal retiming
- **Tasks**
  - conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify measures for corridor mobility analysis and network-wide performance evaluation using multiple traffic data sources
  - programmed and deployed scripts using R Shiny, SQL, and Docker to develop a network-wide mobility assessment tool for assessing corridor-level traffic operations and safety metrics
  - proposed a methodology to create time-space diagrams along consecutive intersections using high-resolution event data from signal controllers and detectors
- **Tools used**: SQL, R for data analysis and visualization, Shiny and Docker for dashboard deployment
