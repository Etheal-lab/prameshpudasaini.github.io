# Queue Length Estimation using Single-Channel Detector Data
### *Independent Research (6/2020 - 1/2021)*

- **Scope**: pre-disaster planning and performance evaluation of rural road networks in case of link disruption
- **Contributions**
  - proposed two mathematical metrics for quantifying network redundancy in context of rural roads; metrics are based on the change in total travel distance for rerouting the network traffic when a link fails
  - performed redundancy analysis for a real-world rural road network by implementing Dijkstra's and k-shortest path algorithms in MATLAB
  - developed a decision-support tool for a priori identification of critical road links and maintenance prioritization of existing alternative links
- **Tools used**: MATLAB for implementing Dijkstra's and k-shortest path algorithms ([code sample](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/network_redundancy/tree/main/matlab-scripts)), Excel for data analysis & visualization
- **Publications**: J. K. Shrestha, **P. Pudasaini**, and L. Mussone, ‚ÄúRural road network performance and pre-disaster planning: an assessment methodology considering redundancy,‚Äù *Transportation Planning and Technology*, vol. 44, no. 7, pp. 726‚Äì743, 2021, doi: [10.1080/03081060.2021.1956809](https://doi.org/10.1080/03081060.2021.1956809).

</p>

- **Scope**: multi-objective optimization of petroleum transportation network under demand uncertainty
- **Contributions**
  - developed a multi-objective optimization model considering demand stochasticity
  - considered multiple supply centers, distribution centers, products, and transportation modes, along with transshipment between centers
  - formulated optimization model as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved the model in GAMS
  - generated Pareto optimal solutions to analyze interesting trade-offs between objectives
  - proposed a decision-support tool for strategic (long-term infrastructure setup) and tactical planning (petroleum products' flow allocation) under stochastic demands
- **Tools used**: [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) for optimization ([code sample](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/integrated_dpsc/blob/main/optimization/gams-stochastic.gms)), R for data analysis & visualization
