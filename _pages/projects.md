</p>

- **Scope**: multi-objective optimization of petroleum transportation network under demand uncertainty
- **Tasks & contributions**
  - developed a multi-objective optimization model considering demand stochasticity
  - considered multiple supply centers, distribution centers, products, and transportation modes, along with transshipment between centers
  - formulated optimization model as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem and solved the model in GAMS
  - generated Pareto optimal solutions to analyze interesting trade-offs between objectives
  - proposed a decision-support tool for strategic (long-term infrastructure setup) and tactical planning (petroleum products' flow allocation) under stochastic demands
- **Tools used**: [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) for optimization ([code sample](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/integrated_dpsc/blob/main/optimization/gams-stochastic.gms)), R for data analysis & visualization
- **Affiliation**: Master's graduate at Tribhuvan University; Deputy Manager at Nepal Oil Corporation Limited
- **Publication**: "Integrated planning of downstream petroleum supply chain: a multi-objective stochastic approach" ([paper link](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orp.2021.100189))
