- **Focus**: multi-objective optimization of petroleum transportation network under demand uncertainty
- **Goals**: develop a mathematical multi-objective optimization model; analyze Pareto optimal solutions in deterministic and stochastic settings
- **Tools used**: [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) for optimization ([code sample](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/biobjective_petroleum/blob/main/optimization/gams-stochastic-t3.gms)), Excel for data analysis & visualization
- **Affiliation**: Center for Infrastructure Development Studies, Tribhuvan University
- **Publication**: "Rural road network performance and pre-disaster planning: an assessment methodology considering redundancy" ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1080/03081060.2021.1956809))

</p>

- **Scope**: multi-objective optimization of petroleum transportation network under demand uncertainty
- **Contributions**: formulated a stochastic, multi-objective for multi-objective optimization, considering multiple products, transportation modes, and transshipment between centers; generated Pareto optimal solutions to analyze interesting trade-offs between objectives
- **Contributions**: proposed a decision-support tool for tactical planning (petroleum products' flow allocation) under deterministic and stochastic demands
- **Tools used**: [GAMS](https://www.gams.com/) for optimization ([code sample](https://github.com/prameshpudasaini/biobjective_petroleum/blob/main/optimization/gams-stochastic-t3.gms)), Excel for data analysis & visualization
- **Affiliation**: Master's student at Tribhuvan University; Deputy Manager at Nepal Oil Corporation Limited
- **Publication**: "A multi-objective analysis of a petroleum transportation network under uncertainty" ([paper link](https://doi.org/10.1504/IJLSM.2021.120254))
